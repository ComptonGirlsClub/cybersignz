            <h1>Mental Health</h1><h5>
            </h5>
            <p id="name_description">Mental health is something that is often overlooked and left behind as an afterthought. It’s something that is equally as important as your physical health. Which, you should be taking care of and prioritizing. 

                There’s a common misconception that taking care of your mind requires overspending and being productive. And although buying things and achieving goals that we set for ourselves can make us feel better, money and productivity aren’t requirements that need to be met in order to take care of your brain. Sometimes, doing nothing all day can restore your body with the energy that it needs, especially if you’ve been under tremendous stress or if you’ve been struggling.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Water Poem</h2>
<p>Pisces, I am her <br>
    Anchored by the stars in the open sky  <br>
    her hips sway to the beat of their own tempo <br>
    Her true nature is one of fluidity, emotional expression <br>
    In love with her own solitude, the universe within <br>
    She reminds us that the bravest step one can take is by way of going inward <br>
    
    Scorpio, I am her <br> 
    She will call you out of your deepest corners  <br>
    Of hiding and invite you to your edge  <br>
    For she has seen what you are to become <br>
    Bone deep and exposed her passion is contagious  <br>
    She is on a frequency all her own  <br>
    She is full of grasp  <br>
    A force of nature <br>
    Standing in her truth with both eyes open.  <br>
    
    Cancer, I am her  <br>
    She is a daughter of the moon <br>
    The way she moves breathes and creates  <br>
    Is all a direct extension of her heart space  <br>
    She feels things deeply <br>
    Connected on a cellular level a higher way of being  <br>
    As the moon turns so does she  <br>
    With each phase of its lunar cycle revealing the shifting hues of her awakening  <br>
    Your morning coffee, she is a fresh bloom <br>
    White linen sheets, and  a vivid daydream 
    </p>
